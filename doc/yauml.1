.SH NAME
.B yauml
- A script for generating UML diagrams from YAML file.

.SH SYNOPSYS
.B yauml [-t \fItemplate_file\fP] [-o \fIout_file\fP] \fIfile.yaml\fP

.B yauml [-hv]

.\" DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates a formatted string from an YAML file according to the dot programming language interpreted 
by \fBGraphviz\fP. The output can then be used by \fBdot\fP in order to get a file in png, pdf, or 
another file format supported (see \fBdot\fP(1)).

.\" OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-t, --template\fP \fItemplate_file\fP
The template file to use (default: \fBTEMPLATE_FILE\fP).
.TP
\fB-o, --out\fP \fIout_file\fP
The file to output the generated result (default: \fBstdout\fP).
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
Shows a help text on \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fP
Version of the program.

\fBTEMPLATE_FILE\fP
/usr/share/yauml/template.dot

This file is written accordingly to the \fBdot\fP programming language. However, in order to properly use \fByauml\fP,
it is required to place some flags in the file so that the program finds where to inject the right string at the right
place. Those flags are the following:

.IP
- // CLASSES

- // INTERFACES

- // USE RELATIONS

- // INHERIT RELATIONS

- // ISPARTOF RELATIONS

.\" INSERT ALL FLAGS HERE

All of these flags consist in a commented line containing the word "CLASSES" or "INTERFACES" or ...  
in capital letters (note that "// The CLASSES here" would be valid too). Each of those flags have to
be followed by another line containing the string "\fB%s\fP".

.B EXAMPLE:

// CLASSES

%s

This would indicate that the class string made from the YAML file information would be placed there (\fBNote\fP:
A not flagged "%s" string will result in an error and the program will exit).
